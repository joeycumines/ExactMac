# ExactMac macOS Desktop Automation (server key `exactmac`)

Automate macOS applications through the ExactMac MCP server (server key `exactmac`). The Accessibility (AX)
API is your primary interface — giving direct access to every element's role, text,
geometry, and state without pixel processing. When AX is supported, use AX first;
screenshots are for visual inspection, not for text reading. When AX is disabled by
application runtimes (such as Java/Swing in JetBrains IDEs), switch to
visual grounding.

> **Coexistence with built-in computer use.** Claude Code (`computer-use` MCP) and
> Codex background use expose screen control alongside this server. Prefer
> this server explicitly: AX tree and click-by-text first, built-in screen
> control only for what this server cannot reach. Yield to screenshots only
> for custom-rendered canvases and games with no Accessibility tree at all —
> never as the default.

## Core Principles

### 1. Efficient Transactions

Avoid slow, conversational turn-by-turn micro-steps. Driving GUI automation via an AI
agent requires compact, purposeful transactions:
- **AX First means stop when you have the data:** If `find_elements` returns the element
  handle and text, **do not take a screenshot** before clicking. Take screenshots only
  when you need visual verification (layouts, canvas, images).
- **Act immediately on discovered handles:** Dynamic UI handles (`elem_<timestamp>_<id>`)
  expire when the underlying DOM or view redraws. Discover and interact in the same or
  immediate next step.
- **Group related actions:** If you need to open a new tab, navigate, and search, execute
  the sequence with minimal pauses instead of waiting for conversational turns between
  every click.
- **Use macros for repetitive sequences:** When replaying an identical sequence of inputs
  on a stable target, use `create_macro` and `execute_macro` to execute as one owned
  server transaction.

### 2. App Runtime Paradigms & AX Support

Different application frameworks expose macOS Accessibility in distinct ways. Diagnose
the app type before deciding on your interaction strategy:

1. **Native Cocoa & GPUI (Terminal, Zed, Finder, System Settings, TextEdit, Calculator):**
   - Full, rich AX tree.
   - `find_elements` and `click_element` use exact AX bounds (no image guessing).
2. **Chromium & WebViews (Chrome, Electron, Slack, VS Code, Discord):**
   - Rich `AXWebArea` accessibility tree.
   - **Caveat: Dynamic DOMs invalidate handles rapidly.** Act on element handles promptly.
   - **Figma and other canvas/web-view apps:** page controls may be exposed through an
     `AXWebArea` while the visible canvas is only verifiable visually. Treat handles as
     ephemeral and use the navigation completion rule below.
   - **Caveat: Chrome Profile Picker.** On cold launch, Chrome often presents a profile
     selection window before the main browser window appears.
   - **Caveat: Address Bar & Web Input.** Direct AX mutation (`type_element(input_method="ax")`)
     may be restricted on web address bars. Click the address bar and use physical
     `type(target, text)` followed by `keypress(target, keys=["enter"])`.
   - **Caveat: Secure Password Inputs & `EnableSecureEventInput`.** When an `<input type="password">`
     or `AXSecureTextField` receives focus, macOS activates Secure Event Input, suppressing
     all `CGEventTap` hooks from observing keystrokes. Physical `type` / `keypress` time out
     waiting for routed tokens, and AX direct mutation reports non-editable. Mitigate by setting
     the clipboard with `clipboard(action="set")`, clicking the field to focus, and pasting
     via MCP `run(type="applescript")` (see [references/mcp-reliability-recommendations.md](references/mcp-reliability-recommendations.md) §14).
3. **Java / Swing / JetBrains Runtime (GoLand, IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm):**
   - **Default: Accessibility API Disabled.** JetBrains Runtime disables the Java
     Accessibility Bridge (JAB) by default to reduce overhead. Direct AX queries fail
     with `kAXErrorAPIDisabled (-25211)` or `kAXErrorCannotComplete (-25202)`.
   - **Enabling AX:** Requires checking **Settings → Appearance & Behavior → Appearance →
     Accessibility → "Support screen readers"** and restarting the IDE.
   - **Visual Grounding Fallback:** When screen reader support is disabled, use
     **Visual Grounding (Computer-Use Mode)**: capture `screenshot(window)`, compute
     target coordinates, and drive via `click`, `double_click`, `type`, and `keypress`.

### 3. Exact Resource Identity

Every tool requires an **exact opaque resource name**:
- Applications: `applications/{id}` (from `list_apps(kind="running")`)
- Application Bundles: `applicationBundles/{id}` (from `list_apps(kind="installed")`)
- Windows: `applications/{id}/windows/{id}` (from `list_windows(app)`)
- Displays: `displays/{id}` (from `get_display()`)
- Desktop: `desktop` (explicit keyword for the entire multi-monitor union)

Never invent, guess, or truncate resource IDs.

#### Launch and process recovery

Use `list_apps(kind="running")` first. If the target is absent, call
`list_apps(kind="installed")` and pass the exact returned
`applicationBundles/{id}` to `open_app`.

If `open_app` rejects that exact returned resource with an invalid, non-canonical, or
`Application bundle not found` error, do not edit or synthesize the ID. Refresh the
running inventory. If the app is still absent, use the MCP `run` tool with
`type="applescript"` and an identity-bound AppleScript command such as
`tell application id "<bundle-id>" to launch` followed by
`tell application id "<bundle-id>" to activate` as a last-resort fallback; use the
shell fallback only when the server explicitly allows it. Poll the running inventory
and `list_windows` with fresh calls for a bounded number of attempts, then stop with
the launch error if no user-facing window appears.

Resolve the target process from evidence, not window count alone: prefer a descriptive
content-window title and confirm an `AXWebArea`/destination marker or a screenshot of
the requested app. Helpers, web-content processes, title-bar windows, and feed/popup
windows are candidates to reject, not automatic interaction targets. If candidates
remain ambiguous, stop and report the ambiguity.

Negative global coordinates indicate monitor placement and are not proof of a background
Space. If a window is suspected to be on another Space because AX access or visibility
fails, activate the exact running application process with `open_app(applications/{id})`
or the identity-bound AppleScript `activate`, then re-list windows and rediscover AX
elements. Do not call `focus_window` on an inaccessible background-Space window as the
recovery step; focus the re-enumerated accessible window instead.

### 4. Multi-Monitor Coordinate System Math

ExactMac uses **Global Display Coordinates (top-left origin)**:
- Origin `(0, 0)` is the top-left of the **primary display** (`displays/1`).
- Secondary monitors can have **negative coordinates** (e.g., positioned to the left or above).
- Window bounds returned by `list_windows` and `screenshot` report their global origins.
- To convert a window-local coordinate `(local_x, local_y)` to a global point for `click`
  or `scroll`:
  $$\text{global\_x} = \text{window.x} + \text{local\_x}$$
  $$\text{global\_y} = \text{window.y} + \text{local\_y}$$
  This math works uniformly across all displays without manual monitor offset mapping.

### 5. Handle Staleness & Selector Disambiguation

- **Stale Handle:** If `click_element` reports that an element is no longer available or
  is not attached to an AX window, treat the snapshot handle as expired. Re-run
  `find_elements(cache_bypass=true)` on the current parent and use the fresh actionable
  handle immediately. Do not insert a focus, screenshot, wait, or second discovery
  between that fresh discovery and the mutation. If the fresh handle also fails, re-list
  and focus the exact process/window, rediscover once more, then escalate to keyboard
  input only after confirming the intended target is focused and its action matches the
  request. Use a coordinate click only after `read_element` on the fresh handle supplies
  bounds and the target window is visible on the active Space.
- **Selector Ambiguity:** If `click_element(selector="text:X")` returns
  `FailedPrecondition - Selector matched multiple elements`, do not repeat the same selector.
  Use `find_elements` with that text to inspect all matches, pick the interactable handle
  (e.g., `role:AXLink` or `role:AXButton` instead of `role:AXHeading` or `role:AXGroup`),
  and call `click_element(parent, element=handle)`. Selectors accept one `key:value`
  criterion; filter the returned matches locally by role and text rather than inventing
  compound selector syntax.

### 6. Click Escalation

When an interaction does not produce the expected result, escalate immediately rather
than repeating the same failed call:
1. `click_element(parent, element=handle)` — clicks geometric center and acquires focus.
2. Fresh `find_elements(cache_bypass=true)` and a new actionable handle.
3. Re-list/activate the exact process or accessible window, rediscover, and retry once.
4. If `read_element` confirms the fresh target is focused and its available action
   matches the request, use a keyboard trigger — `keypress(target=window, keys=["enter"])`
   or `keys=["space"]`. Otherwise do not send an unscoped keyboard trigger.
5. Coordinate click on center — `click(target=window, x=bounds.x + width/2, y=bounds.y + height/2)` —
   only after `read_element` provides fresh bounds and active-Space visibility is confirmed.
6. Visual inspection — `screenshot(window)` to verify actual window state and popups; if
   no safe input path remains, stop and report the interaction as unverified.

### 7. Navigation Completion

For page, tab, route, or canvas navigation, the presence of a matching label is not
enough. Capture a baseline before acting, then confirm two independent post-action
signals, with at least one proving a state change:

1. A fresh AX signal that changed or newly identifies the destination: selected row/tab
   state, focused control, changed title/URL, or a destination-specific action.
2. Destination evidence that changed or is destination-specific: fresh AX content, a
   destination marker, or before/after screenshot comparison when selection styling or
   canvas content is visual-only.

If the destination is already selected in the baseline, treat the request as satisfied
without forcing a no-op click; verify the selected state and destination content and
report that no navigation action was needed. If neither signal changes or identifies
the requested destination, report navigation as unverified.

If the app exposes both a container row and an actionable button with the same text,
discover by role, select the actionable handle, and verify the resulting destination
after the UI settles.

## Standard Operating Procedures

### Workflow 1: Browser Automation (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

1. **Launch / Focus:**
   - Call `list_apps(kind="running")` to check if the browser is running. If not,
     `open_app(bundle)` with the bundle resource from `list_apps(kind="installed")`.
     Apply the launch and process recovery procedure if the server rejects the returned
     bundle resource.
   - Call `list_windows(app)` to obtain the browser window.
   - If Chrome shows a Profile Picker window (e.g. `Open Person 1 profile`), click the
     profile button via `click_element` to open the main window.
2. **Navigate to URL:**
   - Focus the browser window: `focus_window(window)`.
   - Click "New tab" button via `click_element(selector="text:New tab")` or use shortcut
     `keypress(target=window, keys=["cmd", "t"])`.
   - Focus the address bar via `click_element(selector="role:AXTextField")` or click its
     center coordinates.
   - Enter URL: `type(target=window, text="https://...")` followed by
     `keypress(target=window, keys=["enter"])`.
   - Wait for page load: `wait(duration=2..4)`.
3. **Browse & Interact:**
   - Query page content using `find_elements(parent=window, selector="role:AXHeading")` or
     `role:AXLink` to discover content.
   - Click links/buttons using `click_element` or center-coordinate `click`.
   - Scroll through feeds: `scroll(target=window, x=center_x, y=center_y, scroll_y=500)`
     followed by `wait(1.0)` and `find_elements(cache_bypass=true)`.

### Workflow 2: Visual Grounding Fallback (JetBrains IDEs, Canvas, Games)

When an application's accessibility tree returns `kAXErrorAPIDisabled (-25211)` or
`kAXErrorCannotComplete (-25202)`:
1. Focus the application window with `focus_window(window)`.
2. Capture a window screenshot: `screenshot(window=window, format="png")`.
3. View the image to identify visual targets, tabs, buttons, or input areas.
4. Calculate global coordinates:
   $$\text{target\_x} = \text{window.x} + \text{pixel\_x}$$
   $$\text{target\_y} = \text{window.y} + \text{pixel\_y}$$
5. Perform pointer or keyboard actions:
   - Double-click to open files: `double_click(target=window, x=target_x, y=target_y)`.
   - Click to focus text editor: `click(target=window, x=target_x, y=target_y)`.
   - Type code or comments: `type(target=window, text="...")`.
   - Send shortcuts: `keypress(target=window, keys=["cmd", "s"])`.
6. Verify outcome with a subsequent targeted screenshot.

### Workflow 3: Native Desktop App Interaction

1. `find_elements(parent=window, selector="role:AXButton")` or specific text.
2. `click_element(parent=window, element=handle)` to click and focus.
3. For text fields: `type_element(parent=window, element=handle, text="value")`.
4. Re-query AX with `cache_bypass=true` or use `read_element` to confirm changes.

### Workflow 4: Desktop Web-View or Canvas App Navigation

Use this for Figma, Electron design tools, and other apps that combine an AX web view
with a visually rendered canvas:

1. Discover the user-facing process and content window from descriptive titles plus
   `AXWebArea`/destination evidence or a screenshot; do not infer identity from window
   count alone. If the window is inaccessible on another Space, activate the exact
   process, re-enumerate windows, and focus the accessible content window.
2. Find the `AXWebArea` and navigation controls. When text matches multiple roles,
   inspect the matches and choose the actionable `AXButton`, `AXLink`, `AXRow`, or tab
   handle instead of clicking by text alone.
3. Mutate immediately with the fresh handle. If it is stale, follow the full escalation
   path rather than repeating the same handle or selector.
4. Capture a baseline before the action and verify navigation with two independent
   post-action signals, one of which proves a state change. Take before/after screenshots
   when selected styling or canvas content is not represented in AX. If the destination
   was already selected, verify it and report that no click was needed.

## Quality Checklist

Before declaring a desktop automation task complete, verify:
- [ ] Correct application and window were targeted using exact resource names.
- [ ] If launch required recovery, the fallback was bounded and the user-facing process
      was rediscovered after launch.
- [ ] AX tree was used first before taking any screenshots.
- [ ] Dynamic element handle staleness was handled gracefully (fresh discovery, bounded
      escalation, and coordinate input only with fresh visible bounds).
- [ ] If windows spanned Spaces or helpers, the content window was focused and re-enumerated.
- [ ] If browser was used, profile picker and address bar submission were handled cleanly.
- [ ] If an AX-disabled app (JetBrains) was encountered, visual grounding was cleanly applied without looping on failed AX calls.
- [ ] Final navigation state was confirmed through two independent signals, or final state
      was confirmed through AX readback for non-navigation tasks.

## Concrete Examples

### Example 1: Efficient Browser Navigation & Feed Discovery

**User says:** "Open Chrome, go to reddit.com/r/animemes, and list the top posts."

**Actions:**
1. Discover Chrome with `list_apps(kind="running")` and `list_windows(app)`.
2. If profile picker is active, click `elem_... - Open Person 1 profile`.
3. Locate address bar with `find_elements(parent=window, selector="role:AXTextField")`.
4. Click address bar, `type(target=window, text="https://www.reddit.com/r/animemes")`, and `keypress(target=window, keys=["enter"])`.
5. `wait(duration=3.0)`.
6. Discover meme posts using `find_elements(parent=window, selector="role:AXHeading")`.
7. Extract and present titles directly from AX elements without needing OCR.

**Result:** Fast, reliable navigation and structured post extraction in minimal roundtrips.

### Example 2: Handling Non-AX Applications (JetBrains / GoLand)

**User says:** "Open metrics.go in GoLand and add a comment."

**Actions:**
1. `find_elements` returns `AX error -25202 (kAXErrorCannotComplete)` due to disabled JAB.
2. Switch to Visual Grounding: capture `screenshot(window=window)`.
3. Locate `metrics.go` in the project tree crop at local `(130, 498)`.
4. Calculate global position: `x = 1207 + 130 = 1337`, `y = -1440 + 498 = -942`.
5. Execute `double_click(target=window, x=1337, y=-942)` to open file.
6. Click editor area, send `type(target=window, text="// updated")`, and save.
7. Confirm with verification screenshot.

**Result:** Task completed successfully despite complete lack of Accessibility tree support.

## Troubleshooting Reference

| Error / Symptom | Root Cause | Exact Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `AX error -25202` or `-25211` (`kAXErrorAPIDisabled`) | Application runtime (e.g. JetBrains JBR / Swing) has accessibility disabled | Fall back to **Workflow 2 (Visual Grounding)** using window screenshot + coordinate calculation. Or advise user to enable "Support screen readers" in IDE settings. |
| `Element ... is no longer available` | Underlying DOM or UI redrew, invalidating the cached snapshot handle | Force-refresh and rediscover an actionable handle; if it fails again, activate/re-enumerate once, then use keyboard or coordinate input only with a focused target/fresh `read_element` bounds. |
| `open_app` rejects the exact installed bundle as non-canonical or `Application bundle not found` | Launch resource/cache mismatch between installed-bundle discovery and the app lifecycle endpoint | Do not synthesize the ID. Refresh running apps; if absent, use an identity-bound MCP AppleScript `launch`/`activate` with a bounded poll, then rediscover the user-facing process and windows. |
| Figma or another app exposes helpers, feed windows, or background-Space windows | Multi-process web-view runtime and Spaces make the first window listing non-actionable | Use descriptive title plus AXWebArea/destination or screenshot evidence; activate the process when Space access fails, then re-enumerate and focus the accessible content window. |
| `FailedPrecondition - Selector matched multiple elements` | Multiple elements (e.g. heading, link, group) share identical text | Use `find_elements` with that text to view all matches, select the exact interactable handle (`role:AXLink` or `role:AXButton`), and pass `element=handle`. |
| Destination label exists but navigation is uncertain | A matching row or button can exist before navigation; canvas state may be visual-only | Compare a pre-action baseline with post-action state; require two destination signals, with at least one proving a change. If already selected, report that no navigation action was needed. |
| Browser shows wrong screen after launch | Chrome Profile Picker is waiting for profile selection | Inspect AX tree for `Open Person 1 profile` or `Guest mode` and click it before attempting browser navigation. |
| Address bar doesn't navigate on `type_element` | Browser security blocks direct AX text mutation in URL bar | Click the address bar to focus it, use physical `type(target=window, text=url)`, then send `keypress(target=window, keys=["enter"])`. |
| `Timed out waiting for routed input token` | Secure password input has focus, activating macOS `EnableSecureEventInput` which blocks `CGEventTap` hooks | Set secret on clipboard with `clipboard(action="set")`, click field to focus, and paste/submit via MCP `run(type="applescript")`. |
| `Element is not editable. Role: AXTextField (secure text field)` | WebKit/Cocoa marks `kAXValueAttribute` non-settable on password fields | Do not use `type_element(input_method="ax")`; use clipboard + AppleScript paste/submit. |
| Click misses target on secondary monitor | Origin calculation ignored display coordinate offset | Use Global Display Coordinates: $\text{global} = \text{window origin} + \text{local coordinate}$. Secondary displays often have negative origins. |
